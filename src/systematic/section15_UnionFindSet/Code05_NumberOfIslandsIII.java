 * @Description: Design a framework that can perform this island task in parallel.
 * @Note:   Idea: Divide and Conquer: the main program distributes grid to separate subprograms. Each subprogram stores
 *                                    the representative of each island. The main program collects islands on dividing
 *                                    boundaries, and union them based on representatives.
