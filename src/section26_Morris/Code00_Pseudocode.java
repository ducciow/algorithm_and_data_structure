 * @Description: Pseudocode of Morris traversal of a binary tree.
 * @Note:   - For null pointers of a binary tree itself, by redirecting them and then undo the redirection, to
 *            achieve the space complexity O(1).
 *          ======
 *          - Those nodes with left child are traversed twice, otherwise are traversed once.
 *          - In general for applications, specific operations take place sometime during the two traversals.
 *          ======
 *          - Unlike binary tree DP, it does not require entire info from subtreeã€‚
