        If:
            1. It is a range splitting problem with two varying arguments.
            2. There is iteration for each cell.
            3. When fix one argument, there is monotonicity between the other argument and the answer.
            4. The pair of monotonicity is reversely related.
            5. There is a pair of (lower, upper) that bounds the iteration, usually residing in (left_cell, down_cell)
               or (up_cell, right_cell).

        Note:
            1. It is hard to draw a conclusion if it should proceed when it meets equal current-next outcome.
            2. Quadrangle inequality can only optimize your current solution strategy.
